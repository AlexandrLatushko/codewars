<!-- For now, you want the player to start with just the stick. Change the inventory array to have stick as its only value. -->

 Assuming you have an existing inventory array
let inventory = ["sword", "shield", "potion"];

 Change the inventory array to have "stick" as its only value
inventory = ["stick"];

Now the inventory array contains only "stick"
console.log(inventory);
